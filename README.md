Jobs Analysis Project
Aim
The aim of this project is to analyze jobs across India and generate insights through a collaborative effort.

Dataset
We obtained our dataset by scraping data with Selenium from the LinkedIn website. The scraped data included job data, job level, job title, company name, employment counts, location, and followers. The raw data was cleaned using Python and Pandas to ensure accuracy and prepare the data for analysis.

Methodology
The data was analyzed using SQL. [Insert name of contributor] was responsible for this part of the project. We used various SQL queries to extract useful insights from the dataset. The queries included filtering, aggregation, and joining of the data.

Results
Through our analysis, we were able to generate several insights, including:

The city with the most number of jobs
The most popular job titles and their average salary
The companies with the most job postings
The distribution of job levels across companies
[Insert any other insights you discovered]
Dashboard
We created a dynamic dashboard using Excel to present our insights in a visually appealing and interactive way.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we were able to gain valuable insights into job trends in India through our collaborative effort. We hope that our findings can be used to inform future job seekers and companies in their hiring strategies.
